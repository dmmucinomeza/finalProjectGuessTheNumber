OBJECTIVE: 
This program will allow the user to guess the randomly computer generated number.

- insert a random number generator

- create code that takes 'input' from the computer
- add statements at the end and the beinning that welcome and thank the user for playing
- add statements after each input to give them clues (too high, or too low)

PSEUDOCODE: 

# randint function to generate the random number between 1 to 9
# print a statement asking for user's name
# print another greeting statement 

# number of chances to be given to the user to guess the number  
# the number of chances to put in the input box are 5 

# While loop to count the number of chances 
    # Enter a number between 1 to 9  
    # Compare the user entered number with the number to be guessed  
    # if number entered by user is same as the generated number by randint function 
        # then break from loop using loop control statement "break" 
    # Check if the user entered number is smaller than the generated number 
# If the user entered number is greater than the generated number 
    # Increase the value of chance by 1 
# Check whether the user guessed the correct number
# print a goodbye statement
